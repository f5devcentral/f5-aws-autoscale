# Instructions: 
# Rename this file to config.yaml and update the variables. 
# config.yaml is not tracked in git.

# NOTE: NOT all input parameters used in the templates are listed below. In some cases, we just rely on the default variables in the templates. However, you would like to change the default values, simply add any of the parameters you want below. Simply add the exact name of the parameter it below and deploy_stacks script will add it the stacks. 


# REQUIRED
# aws/ec2 region where you want to deploy
# ex. region: us-east-1
region: <name of AWS region>

# REQUIRED
# arbitrary name for your deployment, must follow CFT naming conventions
# MaxLength = 20 characters
# ex. deploymentName: example-1
deploymentName: example-1

# REQUIRED
# BIG-IP username &  password
# ex. adminUsername: joe
# ex. adminPassword: GoF5!
# ***EXCEPTION***
#		NOT REQUIRED in deployments/waf-sandwich-utility-only-clustered,
#		1) adminUsername default to cluser-admin
#		2) adminPassword no longer a input parameter, but auto-generated by f5-cloud-libs
adminUsername: <admin_username>
adminPassword: <admin_password>

# REQUIRED
# the name of your ssh key pair in ec2 as seen in the console, don't include the .pem
# ex. sshKey:  my-key-pair
sshKey: <ec2 ssh key pair>

# Access credentials for BIG-IP to interact with AWS services
# AWS does not recommend using AWS Access / Secret Keys on instances in AWS
# Only required in deployments/templates which don't leverage IAM roles yet
# Keeping Setting for testing of legacy deployments (pre v13). 
# ex. iamAccessKey: A....Q
# ex. iamSecretKey: Os....ASJD22
iamAccessKey: <aws access key>
iamSecretKey: <aws secret key>

# REQUIRED
# 2 availability zones required
# NOTE: most regions only support 2 AZs so example VPC (deployed in common.template) only has 2 AZs
# availabilityZones: <availability zone 1>,<availability zone 2>
# ex. availabilityZones: us-east-1b,us-east-1c
availabilityZones: <availabilty zones>

# OPTIONAL: Defaults to 8443
# Big-IP Management Gui Port
# ex. managementGuiPort: "8443"
managementGuiPort: "8443"

# OPTIONAL (Only for deployments w/ BYOL)
# license key for your byol bigip
# ex. licenseKey1: CPOIB-VGPHS-BCGGD-JXBYE-XWKWMUO
licenseKey1: <license key>

# OPTIONAL (in "SSL-" based deployments)
# pfx ssl certificate URL 
# Otherwise, the system default cert will be used
# certificateUrl: https://s3.amazonaws.com/yourbucket/website.pfx
certificateUrl: default

# OPTIONAL (in some sandwich deployments)
# ssl certificate id used if ELB terminating SSL
# ex. certificateId: arn:aws:iam::111111111111:server-certificate/f5example-cert
certificateId: <certificate id>

# OPTIONAL Throughput
# Dictates size of utility instances (25Mbps, 200Mbps, 1000Mbps)
# ex. throughput: "1000Mbps" 
throughput: "1000Mbps" 

# OPTIONAL (Default is set artificially low for testing. Recommended to adjust as ratio to utility size)
# ex. 80% of Throughput
# Scale Up Bytes Threshold = 
# 25 Mbps   = 3276800 bytes   * .80 =   2621440
# 200 Mbps  = 26214400 bytes  * .80 =  20971520
# 1000 Mbps = 131072000 bytes * .80 = 104857600
# 5000 Mbps = 655360000 bytes * .80 = 524288000
# ex. scaleUpBytesThreshold: "35000"
scaleUpBytesThreshold: "35000"


# OPTIONAL (Default  is for testing. Recommended Adjust to Uitlity Size)
# Scale Down Bytes Threshold
# ex. ScaleDownBytesThreshold: "10000"
scaleDownBytesThreshold: "10000"

# OPTIONAL (but highly recommended) 
# email for autoscaling events
notificationEmail: user@example.com

# OPTIONAL 
# 'true' if you want to deploy a host with jmeter installed for testing, else 'false'
deploy_jmeter_host: true
